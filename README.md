This Solidity code is a Smart Contract for a letter of credit.
In this model, we have one Exporter (who sells the products) and the Issuing Bank, who deploys the SC on the buyer's request. Documents must be submitted by the exporter and validated by Issuing Bank.
This code was developed for a Masters's Degree project about Blockchain in International Commerce (https://openaccess.uoc.edu/bitstream/10609/146956/3/tribabTFM0622memoria.pdf)
